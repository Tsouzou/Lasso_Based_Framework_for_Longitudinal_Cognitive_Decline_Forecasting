## NeuroPredict: A Lasso-Based Framework for Longitudinal Cognitive Decline Forecasting

Our project, NeuroPredict, commenced with an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aimed at identifying the principal sources of variance in this Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. A preliminary correlation matrix, supplemented by univariate histograms, revealed conspicuous skewness in multiple volumetric variables (e.g., Ventricles, Hippocampus) and confirmed a strongly linear relationship between baseline and 24-month ADAS13 scores. These observations served as the impetus for subsequent feature transformations, including log or Box-Cox approaches, specifically designed to stabilize variance and remedy potential heteroskedasticity.

In addressing missingness, we distinguished between features exhibiting minimal absent values (e.g., APOE4) and those suffering copious data depletion (e.g., volumetric measures such as Hippocampus). The former were rectified using simple imputation (mean, median, or constant fill), while the latter mandated row-wise elimination to prevent egregious data leakage or bias. This dual-tiered procedure, coupled with robust transformations, optimally preserved dataset integrity.

For categories, psychological and demographic constructs (DX.bl, PTGENDER, PTRACCAT, etc.) were processed through a specialized pipeline featuring SimpleImputer with a constant placeholder for null entries, followed by OneHotEncoder to yield numeric indicators. This pipeline not only mitigated computational instability in the presence of rare categories but also facilitated matrix operations required by most learning algorithms.

Subsequently, we evaluated various regression models—Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso—to approximate the functional relationships among neuroimaging variables, APOE4 alleles, and ADAS13 cognitive scores. While the baseline linear model captured a portion of the variance, Ridge and Lasso regularizations reduced overfitting and improved interpretability. Of these two, Lasso proved superior in striking a balance between estimation accuracy and parsimony of coefficients, thus elucidating the principal drivers of cognitive decline (notably, baseline ADAS13, hippocampal volume, and APOE4 genotype).

Finally, NeuroPredict culminates in a Lasso-based predictive pipeline, capable of systematically identifying individuals at elevated risk of cognitive deterioration. Despite inherent constraints—such as reliance on a partial subset of the broader ADNI population and the omission of certain lifestyle or socio-economic variables—this model provides a scientifically robust and computationally efficient framework. Periodic retraining on more granular or evolving data (e.g., nutrition, exercise, psychosocial factors) could refine predictive validity further, establishing NeuroPredict as a theoretically grounded and practically salient tool for forecasting longitudinal cognitive trajectories.
